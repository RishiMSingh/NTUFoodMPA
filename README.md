Mobile Application

Due to the overwhelming increase in the coronavirus numbers, the food industry has been at a significant loss, with 
sales dropping 56.6% compared to the previous year. Slowly post lockdown, many businesses saw a slight increase in sales, 
but due to society's fear, the number of sales was not as close to the year before. Businesses must start performing like 
they used but by adopting a new strategy. The new system involves the order and collect process introducing technology to the 
world of business. I believe that this app proposal's investment will increase sales, follow government guidelines, and increase 
public spending confidence.

A Order & Collect mobile application for Nottingham Trent University, specifically the Clifton campus has been created. 
Clifton Campus has three main food outlets which include, Barista, The Point, and The Refectory. These three food outlets can 
see long queues of students, staff, and the general public during busy hours. Due to the coronavirus, people would like to 
minimise unnecessary contact with other individuals. Hence, the app's introduction will increase the general public's spending 
confidence, along with growing sales and making the businesses more efficient.
